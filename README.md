# Banker's Algorithm (C++)

This project implements the **Banker's Algorithm**, a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems to allocate resources safely among multiple processes.

## 💡 What It Does

- Reads:
  - The number of processes and resources.
  - Claim matrix (maximum resource need for each process).
  - Allocation matrix (currently allocated resources).
  - Total available resources.
- Calculates the **available resource matrix**.
- Checks whether the system is in a **safe state** by simulating process execution.
- Outputs a possible **safe sequence** if one exists.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Turbo C++ / DOSBox** (for compatibility with `conio.h`, `clrscr()`, and `gotoxy()` functions)
- Standard C++ compiler (with modifications to remove DOS-specific headers)

> ⚠️ Note: `#include<iostream.h>` and `#include<conio.h>` are not standard in modern C++. Consider replacing them for compatibility with modern compilers (see "Modernizing Tips" below).

## 📥 Input Example

Enter number of processes: 3
Enter number of resources: 3

Claim Matrix:
7 5 3
3 2 2
9 0 2

Allocation Matrix:
0 1 0
2 0 0
3 0 2

Resources Vector:
10 5 7
## ✅ Output Example
p2 p1 p3 is one of the safe states
## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

The algorithm works in a loop:
1. It tries to find a process whose remaining needs can be satisfied with current available resources.
2. If such a process is found, it is "executed" — its allocated resources are released back to the pool.
3. This continues until all processes complete or no more progress can be made.

## 🔧 Modernizing Tips (optional)

If you'd like to run this code with a modern C++ compiler:
- Replace `#include<iostream.h>` with `#include <iostream>` and add `using namespace std;`
- Remove or replace `conio.h` functions (`clrscr()`, `gotoxy()`, `getch()`)
- Change `void main()` to `int main()` and return 0 at the end
